\section{Introduction to HTN Planning}

Point \ref{enum:intro:introduction} is important as you should not assume any technical background in the specific technical area of your work. Provide some high-level introduction (without technical definitions) that can be understood by anybody with some basic mathematical understanding. What such an accurate level of abstraction/presentation is might depend on the specific topic of your thesis. Also consult your supervisor(s) for his/her (their) opinion(s) and preferences. 
 

\section{Motivation}
Point \ref{enum:intro:motivation} should make clear why the conducted research (or experiments etc.)\ is relevant and important. This is the part where you should make the readers interested in your work! Convince them to continue reading your work!

Be specific about the precise contributions that your work actually does and list them in the text (preferably in its own paragraph; depending on the number of contributions and how well they can be separated you could also provide them in a bullet point list).

\section{Potential pros and cons of total vs. partial order}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Advantages of Partial Order:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item plan recognition: independent goals can be described in parallel (Daniel should be able to write something about that)
		\item  partial order is more expressive (both in terms of plan existence and in terms of computational complexity) meaning that more problems can be expressed
		\item Domain model might be more intuitive: if a task is independent of some others it might be counter-intuitive to demand a certain position of it (if artificially made totally ordered)
	\end{itemize}
	\item Advantages of Total Order:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item computational complexity is lower (fewer worst-case solving time)
		\item we can exploit specialised algorithms as well as heuristics. Note that heuristic design is comparably easy for total-order problems due to the missing interaction between tasks.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Further advantages from having a compilation of PO into TO plans}
\begin{itemize}
	\item We actually get another class of decidable partially ordered problems that's orthogonal to tail-recursive ones! (Because if the criterion 'matches', we know that the PO domain is equivalent to the resulting TO domain; the latter is decidable whereas the former is not.) 
	\item We can use more efficient algorithms and heuristics. 
\end{itemize}
