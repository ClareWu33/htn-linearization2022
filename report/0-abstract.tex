\chapter*{Abstract}


After the decomposition of a partially ordered HTN planning problem into k plan steps, in the worst case scenario there are k! possible solutions to consider when searching for a executable refinement of the plan steps.
A large search space can be an advantage in case not enough is known about the domain to sensibly ensure a smaller search space will hold solutions,
but also a disadvantage in the case that the search space is too large to efficiently search through. We attempt to linearize partially ordered HTN planning problems in 
order to reduce this disadvantage, while attempting to preserve at least one solution in the reduced search space.
We test our techniques on the partially-ordered track of the bench-mark set of the IPC 2020. We use the Panda progression search planner on both linearised and partially-ordered problem. 
We find that in the majority of domains, the linearized problem can be solved faster. We also find that for the majority of problems, the linearized problem remains solvable.
